            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Orion. I am trying to explore this writing side of myself as its something I haven't tapped into since I was a young kid. With a background in technology, I've always been fascinated by how it impacts our lives. This blog is my platform to share insights, stories, and reflections on a variety of topics that pique my interest and, hopefully, yours too.</p>
            <p>When I'm not writing, you can find me skateboarding, hiking, or exploring new things. I believe in lifelong learning and am constantly seeking new experiences and knowledge. Join me on this journey, and let's explore the wonders of the world together.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my blog. Feel free to reach out through the contact page if you'd like to connect or have any questions!</p>
